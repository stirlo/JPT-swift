## About Jewish Prayer Times

Jewish law requires praying three times daily - in the morning (Shacharit), afternoon (Minchah), and evening (Maariv/Arvith). This custom originated from the three patriarchs:

- Abraham introduced morning prayer, representing love in serving God
- Isaac introduced afternoon prayer, representing awe
- Jacob added evening prayer, representing mercy

The Torah commands serving God with all our heart and soul, which we fulfill through prayer. Over time, our sages formulated the basic structure of morning, afternoon, evening, and holiday prayers as we have them today.
